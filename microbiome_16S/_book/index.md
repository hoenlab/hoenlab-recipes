# Introduction 

This book is an attempt to institutionalize some knowledge about processing and analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. This is in no way a comprehensive resource, but rather a way to collect disparate information from various lab members for usage as either a training or reference resource. 

## What this book includes 

So far, this book contains the following chapters: 


## What it will include in the future  

Some planned content include:   

* Biological background on 16S rRNA gene sequencing data sets    
* Understanding raw sequence data sets   
* Using `DADA2` to retrieve amplicon sequence variants   
* Load processed data sets into `phyloseq` and perform various pre-processing and transformation    
* Diversity and ordination analyses    
* Differential abundance analysis    
* Predictive modelling    
* Additional downstream analyses
